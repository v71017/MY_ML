# HR-Analytics

Human Resources Analytics is a simulated dataset, downloaded from kaggle.com. It contains the data of
the employees of a fictional company. Some of the employees have left the company, and the vendor wants to find an answer to why these employees had left the company.

This repository contains two applications on the dataset, classifying new instances and predicting who will leave next.
